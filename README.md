# Bridging Realms: Physics Tensors vs Machine Learning Tensors ðŸŒŒðŸ¤–

## Overview

This project explores the **concept of tensors** from two perspectives:
1. **Physics** â€” focusing on stress-energy tensors in **General Relativity** and their transformations under Lorentz boosts.
2. **Machine Learning** â€” demonstrating how tensors are used in **Deep Learning**, particularly in the manipulation of high-dimensional data.

The goal is to provide a hands-on comparison and understanding of tensor operations across these two realms.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with a few libraries. The following steps will guide you through the setup:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bridging-realms.git
    cd bridging-realms
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional, but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once you've set up the environment, you can explore the demo notebooks and scripts:

1. **Physics Tensor Demo**: `notebooks/physics_tensor_demo.ipynb`
    - Demonstrates Lorentz transformations of stress-energy tensors.
   
2. **ML Tensor Demo**: `notebooks/ml_tensor_demo.ipynb`
    - Shows tensor operations (reshaping, transposing) commonly used in machine learning.

3. **Comparison Visualizer**: `notebooks/comparison_visualizer.ipynb`
    - Compares tensor transformations between physics and ML with visualizations.

To run the entire pipeline, simply execute:

```bash
python main.py
```
